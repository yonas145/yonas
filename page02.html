Ancient biotechnology (pre-1800)
In the period before the year 1800, some events that were based on common observations about nature can be categorized as biotechnological developments.Three important basic needs of human civilization are food, clothes and shelter. In the ancient era the paucity of food led to the domestication of food products,formally called ‘agriculture’. During ancient times humans understood the impor￾tance of water, light and other requirements for the optimal growth of food plants and the domestication of different wild animals, which helped them improve their living conditions and satisfy their hunger. The domestication of wild animals was the beginning of the observation, understanding and applications of animal breeding. This initial period of the evolution of farming led to another development in methods for food preservation and storage. The utilization of cold caves or pots (in the form of leather bags and clay jars) to preserve food for long-term storage began. After discovering the basic facts behind the domestication of food crops and wild animals, human beings moved on to other new inventions such as curd, cheese, etc. Cheese can be considered to be one of the first direct products (or by-products) of biotechnology, since it was prepared by adding rennet (an enzyme found in the stomachs of calves) to sour milk. This is only possible when milk is exposed to microbes (although there was no understanding of this at that time). Among all microbial strains, yeast is one of the oldest microbes to have been exploited by humans for their benefit. This primitive microbe has long been employed for the production of alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, wine, beer, etc. Among the oldpreservatives, vinegar has a significant importance because of its low pH and potential in preventing the growth of certain microbes, which means it can be used successfully in food preservation. These discoveries and their significance allowed people to work on further improvement of the processes involved. However, while processes such as the decomposition of debris or other materials, which was later called fermentation, were powerful tools to improve their living conditions, people were ignorant of the principles behind them. Among the most primitive examples of crossbreeding for the benefit of humans is the mule.
