It is well known that the technical application of biological material is considered to be biotechnology. To understand how biotechnology works it is important to think about the starting point or material for biotechnology processes. Generally, biotechnology utilizes living material or biological products to generate new products for use in various medical, agricultural, pharmaceutical and environmental applications. The ultimate goal of biotechnology is to benefit humanity by, for example, the production of resistant crops, vegetables, recombinant proteins, higher milk-producing animals, etc. Different developmental stages have taken place in biotechnology to meet the various needs of humans at the time. Its development was principally based on observations, and the application of these observations to practical scenarios. Owing to the evolution of new technologies and a better understanding of various principles of life science, the complexity of biotechnology has increased.
